# Ride Management System

Welcome to the Ride Management System, a project designed with a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including the four pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.

## Overview:

The Ride Management System is a software solution for efficiently managing rides within a theme park or amusement center. By leveraging the core principles of OOP, this project provides a flexible and extensible framework for handling diverse ride types and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Object-Oriented Principles:

### 1. Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is achieved by bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Each ride is encapsulated within its own class, ensuring that the internal details are hidden, and interactions are controlled through well-defined interfaces.

### 2. Inheritance:

Inheritance facilitates code reuse and establishes a hierarchy among classes. The Ride Management System employs inheritance to create a base `Ride` class with common attributes and behaviors, allowing for the creation of specialized ride types that inherit and extend the functionalities of the base class.

### 3. Abstraction:

Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only relevant features. The Ride Management System abstracts the common characteristics of rides into a generic `Ride` class, allowing users to interact with rides without needing to understand the intricacies of their implementations.

### 4. Polymorphism:

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. The Ride Management System utilizes polymorphism to enable flexibility in managing and interacting with various ride types. Users can work with rides uniformly, regardless of their specific implementations.
